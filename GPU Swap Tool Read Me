> 🚀 How to use the GPU-Swap Tool

> If you are using AMD Radeon or Intel QuickSync instead of the NVIDIA GTX 750, follow these steps to reconfigure the "Zombie" stack:

> Step 1: Run the Swap Script

>  * In your terminal, run: nano gpu-swap.sh

>  * Paste the script code provided in gpu-swap file.

>  * Save and Exit (Ctrl+O, then Ctrl+X).

>  * Run it: chmod +x gpu-swap.sh && ./gpu-swap.sh

> Step 2: Edit the Blueprint (docker-compose.yml)

> You must tell the containers to use the system's Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) instead of the NVIDIA Toolkit.

>  * Open your config: nano ~/mercury/docker-compose.yml

>  * Find the Jellyfin section.

>    3. Delete the lines starting with deploy: and resources:.

>    4. Add these lines exactly under the Jellyfin service name:

> devices:

>   - /dev/dri:/dev/dri  # Maps the GPU to the Zombie

> 

> Step 3: Refresh the Stack

> Run the Mercury reset command to apply the changes:

> m reset

> Step 4: Verify

> Run m gpu to open nvtop. You should now see your AMD or Intel GPU active and ready for transcoding[span_5](end_span)!
