> 🚀 How to use the GPU-Swap Tool
> If you are using AMD Radeon or Intel QuickSync instead of the NVIDIA GTX 750, 
   Follow these steps to reconfigure the "Zombie" stack:
> Step 1: Run the Swap Script
>  * In your terminal, run: nano gpu-swap.sh
>  * Paste the script code provided in gpu-swap.sh file.
>  * Save and Exit (Ctrl+O, then Ctrl+X).
>  * Run it: chmod +x gpu-swap.sh && ./gpu-swap.sh
> Step 2: Edit the Blueprint (docker-compose.yml)
> You must tell the containers to use the system's Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) instead of the NVIDIA Toolkit.
>  * Open your config: nano ~/mercury/docker-compose.yml
>  * Find the Jellyfin section.
>    3. Delete the lines starting with deploy: and resources:.
>    4. Add these lines exactly under the Jellyfin service name:
> devices:
>   - /dev/dri:/dev/dri  # Maps the GPU to the Zombie
> 
> Step 3: Refresh the Stack
> Run the Mercury reset command to apply the changes:
> m reset
> Step 4: Verify
> Run m gpu to open nvtop. You should now see your AMD or Intel GPU active and ready for transcoding[span_5](end_span)!
