⚠️ DO NOT CHANGE CODE UNLESS YOU ARE COMFORTABLE 
   AND KNOW EXACTLY WHAT LINUX OS YOU'RE USING 
 The current commands for GUI control cause reboot 
This is because the systemctl cmds used are universal 
To most linux os versions if you a comfortable and
EXTREMELY CAREFUL!!! You can modify these commands 
in the main install-headless.sh file in alias section 
Make sure all commands are entered exactly right or they won't 
Work if you're GUI Toggle Commands are not working you may 
Have to change them CAREFULLY!!
Switching between a graphical user interface (GUI) and a text-only terminal 
(CLI) on Linux is handled by the display manager (like GDM, LightDM, or SDDM). 
Depending on whether you want a temporary switch or a persistent change for your 
current session, there are a few ways to handle this.1. The Modern Way (systemd)
Most modern distributions (Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, Arch) use systemctl to manage services. 
This is the cleanest way to shut down the GUI.
 * To turn the GUI OFF:
   sudo systemctl isolate multi-user.target
   This stops the graphical session and takes you to a basic command-line login.
 * To turn the GUI ON:
   sudo systemctl isolate graphical.target
2. Managing the Service Directly (Better for pure performance server only mode)
If you just want to stop the specific software that draws the login screen and desktop, 
you can stop the display manager service.
First, identify which one you're using (usually gdm3 for GNOME, sddm for KDE, or 
lightdm for XFCE).
For this specific .sh file ⚠️ if you have another version of Linux check the bottom of the page for info
 * To Stop the GUI:
   sudo systemctl stop gdm3
 * To Start the GUI:
   sudo systemctl start gdm3
3. The "Emergency" Method (TTY)
If your GUI is frozen and you just need to get to a terminal to fix something 
  without actually killing the GUI process yet, use a Virtual Console.
 * Keyboard Shortcut: Press Ctrl + Alt + F3 (or any function key from F3 to F6).
 * To get back to the GUI: Press Ctrl + Alt + F1 or F2.
Summary Table
| Action        | Command                                     |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------|

| Kill GUI      |  sudo systemctl isolate multi-user.target   |

| Restore GUI   |   sudo systemctl isolate graphical.target   |

| Check DM Type | cat /etc/X11/default-display-manager        |

> ⚠️[!IMPORTANT]🛑
> Be sure to save your work before running these commands. Switching targets or 
> stopping the display manager will immediately close all open applications like browsers or document editors.
> Since Zorin OS is based on Ubuntu, it uses the same service management tools. However, the specific 
> command depends on whether you are using Zorin OS Core/Pro (which uses GNOME) or Zorin OS Lite (which uses XFCE).
1. The Recommended Way (Works for both)
The "Isolate" command is the cleanest way because it tells the system to switch states (targets) entirely.
For this specific .sh file ⚠️ if you have another version of Linux check the bottom of the page for info
 * To Turn GUI OFF:
   sudo systemctl isolate multi-user.target
   (This drops you to a full-screen black terminal login.)
 * To Turn GUI ON:
   sudo systemctl isolate graphical.target
2. The Service Method (Version Specific)
If you prefer to stop the display service directly, 
you need to know which version of Zorin you have.
For Zorin OS Core or Pro (GNOME):
 * OFF: sudo systemctl stop gdm3
 * ON: sudo systemctl start gdm3
   For Zorin OS Lite (XFCE):
 * OFF: sudo systemctl stop lightdm
 * ON: sudo systemctl start lightdm
> [!TIP]
> If you aren't sure which one you have, run cat /etc/X11/default-display-manager.
>It will return a path ending in either /gdm3 or /lightdm.
3. Quick Terminal Switch (No "Turning Off")
If you just need a terminal quickly and don't actually need to kill the GUI 
(to save RAM or troubleshoot), use the TTY shortcut:
 * Go to Terminal: Ctrl + Alt + F3
 * Go back to Desktop: Ctrl + Alt + F1 (or F2 depending on your version)
Warning: Always save your work before running the stop or isolate commands! 
These will force-close all open windows and applications immediately.
