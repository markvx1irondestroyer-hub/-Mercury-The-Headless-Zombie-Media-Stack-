🧟 Mercury: The Headless Zombie Media Stack
Author: markvx1irondestroyer-hub
Architecture: Ubuntu/Zorin OS | NVIDIA GTX 750 | Docker Compose
📖 Overview
Mercury is a high-availability, headless media server designed to be a "set and forget" solution. It leverages NVIDIA hardware acceleration for transcoding and uses a "Zombie" persistence logic—ensuring that if a service or the system hangs, it can be revived with a single command.
🛠️ Pre-Deployment Requirements
Before running the installer, ensure your hardware is ready:
 * OS: Ubuntu 22.04+ or Zorin OS 16+.
 * GPU: NVIDIA GTX 750 (or similar) seated and powered.
 * Storage: At least one secondary drive for media (Paths used: /mnt/DVD_Storage and /media/linux/Expansion).
🚀 Installation Steps
1. Clone the Blueprint
Download your personalized scripts from this repository to your home directory:
mkdir ~/mercury && cd ~/mercury
# Download your files from GitHub or copy them into this folder

2. Execute the Foundation Script
The install.sh script automates the installation of NVIDIA drivers, Docker Engine, and the NVIDIA Container Toolkit. It also configures your system aliases.
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh

Note: The system will automatically reboot after completion to initialize the NVIDIA kernel modules.
3. Configure Hardware Mounts
Mercury expects physical drives to be mounted via fstab.
 * Identify your Drive UUIDs: lsblk -f
 * Edit fstab: sudo nano /etc/fstab
 * Add your mounts for DVD_Storage and Expansion.
🕹️ The "M" Master Command
Once installed, you no longer need to remember complex Docker commands. Use the single-letter m interface:
| Command | Function |
|---|---|
| m up | Resurrect: Brings the entire Docker stack online in detached mode. |
| m status | Vitals: Displays real-time drive space, GPU temperature, and container health. |
| m gpu | Monitor: Live 1-second refresh of the GTX 750 performance. |
| m ps | Process: Shows which services are running and their network ports. |
| m reset | Nuclear: Safely stops the stack, prunes system cache, and restarts fresh. |
📂 The Stack Composition
The Golden YAML deploys the following suite:
 * Core: Jellyfin (Media Server), Tailscale (Remote Access), ttyd (Web Terminal).
 * Automation: Sonarr (TV), Radarr (Movies), Prowlarr (Indexers).
 * Utility: qBittorrent (Downloads), FlareSolverr (Bypass).(Optional) you can find and add ARM for adding physical

  Radar Sonar and QBittorrent to work properly.
### **Phase 4: The Final Bridge (Web UI Setup)**
Once the stack is running with `m up`, your "Zombie" is alive, but you must manually configure the connections between the apps. Access each interface via your server's IP address (or `localhost`) at the following ports:

| App | Port | Primary Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Jellyfin** | `8096` | Create your admin account and point libraries to `/data/storage`. |
| **qBittorrent** | `8080` | Set a custom password immediately in **Settings > Web UI**. |
| **Prowlarr** | `9696` | Add your Indexers here; they will automatically sync to Sonarr/Radarr. |
| **Radarr/Sonarr** | `7878 / 8989` | **Settings > Download Clients**: Add qBittorrent using the container name as the host. |
| **Jellyseerr** | `5055` | Connect to your Jellyfin and Radarr/Sonarr via **API Keys** for one-click requests. |

#### **🛠️ Crucial Integration Steps:**
1. **API Keys**: Navigate to **Settings > General** in Radarr, Sonarr, and Prowlarr to find your unique API Keys. Copy these into **Jellyseerr** and **Prowlarr** to "connect the brain" of the stack.
2. **Root Folders**: When setting up Sonarr and Radarr, ensure your "Root Folders" are set to `/data/storage` or `/data/expansion`. This tells the apps exactly where to store your media.
3. **Download Pathing**: In qBittorrent, ensure the save path is directed to your "Landing Zone" on `/data/storage`. Radarr and Sonarr will then automatically move completed files to the "Vault."

## 💾 Optional: External Storage "Internal Trick"  (This is so during Reboot Jellyfin and other Apps don't wake up before drive mounts to see empty library and cause errors)
If you are using an external USB drive (like the **Expansion** drive) as your primary media Vault, follow these steps to "trick" the system into treating it as a permanent internal drive.

### Benefits:
* **Persistence**: The drive mounts automatically at boot.
* **Safety**: If the drive is unplugged, the system will still boot normally thanks to `nofail` logic.
* **Permissions**: Automatically sets ownership to PUID 1000 for Docker compatibility.

### How to Run:
```bash
chmod +x mount-vault.sh
./mount-vault.sh
