1. The Desktop Version (Mercury-The-Headless-Zombie-Media-Stack)
This version keeps the Zorin/Ubuntu Desktop active so you can use it with a monitor, 
but still gives you the single-letter m commands for convenience.
 * Mode: Graphical Desktop remains the default.
 * Best For: Users who still want to use the PC as a computer while it serves media.
 * The Script: Your current install.sh in this repo is correct; it installs 
everything but does not disable the screen.
 * Manual Toggle: You can add the m gui-off command to this script 
if you want the option to turn the screen off later.
2. The Headless Version (-MERCURY-THE-FULL-HEADLESS-ZOMBIE-EDITION-v1.2-)
This version is designed to be "Beheaded" from the start, saving every bit of RAM 
for your GTX 750. or other GPU
 * Mode: Terminal Only (no Desktop GUI).
 * Best For: Dedicated server hardware tucked away in a closet or under a desk.
 * The Script: Your install-headless.sh includes the multi-user.target command, 
which kills the Desktop permanently unless you manually call it back.
