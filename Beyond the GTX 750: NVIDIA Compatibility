​🎮 Beyond the GTX 750: NVIDIA Compatibility
​While this stack was forged for the GTX 750, it is fully compatible with most NVIDIA GPUs.
​Automatic Detection: The install.sh script utilizes ubuntu-drivers autoinstall to identify 
And install the best driver for your specific card.
​Architecture Support: The NVIDIA Container Toolkit and "Golden YAML" logic support Maxwell, 
Pascal, Turing, and Ampere architectures.
​Requirements:
​Ensure your GPU is properly seated and has sufficient power from your PSU.
​For older cards (Legacy), you may need to manually verify if the 470 or 390 driver series is 
Required before running the foundation script.
​🛠️ Updated m command for GPU Monitoring replace with
alias gpu='watch -n 1 nvidia-smi --query-gpu=name,temperature.gpu,utilization.gpu,utilization.memory,memory.used,power.draw --format=csv'
